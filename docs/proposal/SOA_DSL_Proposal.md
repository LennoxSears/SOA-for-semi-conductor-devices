## 📊 Current State Analysis

### The Problem We Face

Our organization processes SOA (Safe Operating Area) rules through a completely manual workflow that is:

- **Time-Intensive**: 1,228 hours (138 days) per rule set
- **Error-Prone**: 15-30% error rates across workflow steps  
- **Inconsistent**: Implementation varies by engineer
- **Non-Scalable**: Limited to 1 rule set per quarter
- **Maintenance-Heavy**: Full re-implementation required for changes

### Rule Complexity Analysis

From our analysis of 277 SOA rules across 13 device types:

| Rule Type | Count | Examples |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Simple Numeric** | 390 | `vhigh: 1.65V` |
| **Temperature Dependent** | 15 | `0.9943V - (0.0006*(T-25))` |
| **Multi-Pin Voltage** | 9 | `min(90, 90+V[p]-v[sub])` |
| **Current with Parameters** | - | `$w*$np*2.12e-4` |
| **tmaxfrac Constraints** | 274 | Time-based transient limits |
| **Complex Equations** | 273 | Mathematical expressions |

### Current Workflow Costs

| Step | Time (Hours) | Error Rate | Cost Impact |
|------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Rule Extraction | 138.5 | 15% | Manual Excel parsing |
| Implementation | 554.0 | 20% | Hand-coding each rule |
| Testing | 277.0 | 25% | Individual test creation |
| Debugging | 138.5 | 30% | Manual error resolution |
| Integration | 40.0 | 10% | CAD tool configuration |
| Documentation | 80.0 | 20% | Manual documentation |
| **TOTAL** | **1,228 hours** | **20% avg** | **$122,800 per rule set** |

## 🎯 Proposed Solution: SOA DSL

### Unified Domain Specific Language

A comprehensive DSL that handles all SOA rule types with unified syntax:

```dsl
rule nmos_core_vds_tmaxfrac {
    name: "NMOS Core VDS with tmaxfrac"
    device: mos_transistor.core.nmos
    parameter: v[d,s]
    type: voltage
    severity: high
    
    constraints {
        vhigh_steady: 1.65,
        vhigh_equation: "1.2 + (T-25)*0.001"
    }
    
    tmaxfrac {
        0.1: 1.71,    // 10% of time
        0.01: 1.84,   // 1% of time
        0.0: 1.65     // Steady state
    }
}
```

### Key DSL Features

- **Unified Syntax**: Single format for all rule types
- **Multi-Pin Support**: `v[d,s]`, `v[g,b]`, etc.
- **Mathematical Expressions**: Full equation support
- **Function Support**: `min()`, `max()`, `abs()`, etc.
- **Temperature Dependencies**: `T`, `temp` variables
- **Device Parameters**: `$width`, `$length`, etc.
- **tmaxfrac Constraints**: Time-based transient limits
- **Conditional Logic**: `if-then-else` constructs
