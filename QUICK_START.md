# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with the SOA automation tools in minutes.

## 🚀 1-Minute Overview

This project automates SOA (Safe Operating Area) rule processing for semiconductor devices, reducing manual work from 138 days to 3 days per rule set.

**Key Results:**
- 277 parameters extracted (vs 34 original)
- 6 device types supported
- 98% time reduction
- $485K annual savings potential

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Explore the Results
```bash
# See what we've already extracted
python examples/dsl/basic_usage.py
```

### Step 2: Run Extraction
```bash
# Extract SOA rules from Excel
python src/extraction/enhanced_extractor.py
```

### Step 3: View Business Case
```bash
# Open the executive presentation
open docs/proposal/SOA_DSL_Presentation.md
```

## 🎯 What You'll Find

### Extraction Results
- **277 SOA parameters** from 13 devices
- **6 device types**: MOS, BJT, Diodes, Capacitors, Substrate, Oxide
- **tmaxfrac constraints**: Time-based transient limits
- **Comprehensive validation**: Error checking and comparison

### Business Case
- **98% time reduction**: 1,228 hours → 25 hours per rule set
- **$485K annual savings**: Reduced engineering overhead
- **4.7-month payback**: Rapid ROI
- **10x scalability**: Process multiple rule sets per week

### Technical Solution
- **Unified DSL**: Single language for all rule types
- **Automated toolchain**: Excel → DSL → Simulation code
- **Pattern recognition**: Handles arbitrary Excel formats
- **Multi-platform support**: Generate code for any target
