    device: mos_transistor.core.nmos
    parameter: v[d,s]
    type: voltage
    severity: high
    
    constraints {
        vhigh_steady: 1.65,
        vhigh_equation: "1.2 + (T-25)*0.001"
    }
    
    tmaxfrac {
        0.1: 1.71,    // 10% of time
        0.01: 1.84,   // 1% of time  
        0.0: 1.65     // Steady state
